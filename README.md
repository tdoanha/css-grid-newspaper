# CSS-Grid Newspaper

## What is this project and why are we doing it?

I'm just messing around with CSS Grid to get some practice. So I thought why not create a newspaper since it has nice grid structure. This is a rough draft of the newspaper. Could be better stylistically, but I think I can spend my time better while I learn more frontend development and get ready for interviews.

## Expected Outcomes

Get better at CSS-Grid
